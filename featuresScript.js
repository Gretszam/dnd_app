Most often, sorcerers with this origin trace their descent back to a mighty sorcerer of ancient times w ho made a bargain with a dragon or who might even have claimed a dragon parent. Some of these bloodlines are well established in the world, but most are obscure. Any given sorcerer could be the first of a new bloodline, as a result of a pact or some other exceptional circumstance. Dragon Ancestor: At 1st level, you choose one type of dragon as your ancestor. The damage type associated with each dragon is used by features you gain later. Draconic Ancestry: Dragon Damage Type, Black Acid Blue Lightning Brass Fire Bronze Lightning Copper Acid Cold Fire Green Poison Red Fire Silver Cold White Cold You can speak, read, and write Draconic. Additionally, whenever you make a Charisma check when interacting with dragons, your proficiency bonus is doubled if it applies to the check. Draconic Resilience: As m agic flows through your body, it causes physical traits of your dragon ancestors to emerge. At 1st level, your hit point maximum increases by 1 and increases by 1 again whenever you gain a level in this class. Additionally, parts of your skin are covered by a thin sheen of dragon-like scales. When you aren’t wearing armor, your AC equals 13 + your Dexterity modifier. Wild Magic: mYour innate m agic com es from the wild forces of chaos that underlie the order of creation. You might have endured exposure to som e form o f raw magic, perhaps through a planar portal leading to Limbo, the Elemental Planes, or the mysterious Far Realm. Perhaps you were blessed by a pow erful fey creature or marked by a demon. Or your magic could be a fluke of your birth, with no apparent cause or reason. However it cam e to be, this chaotic m agic churns within you, waiting for any outlet. Wild Magic Surge: Starting when you choose this origin at 1st level, your spellcasting can unleash surges of untamed magic. Immediately after you cast a sorcerer spell of 1st level or higher, the DM can have you roll a d20. If you roll a 1, roll on the W ild Magic Surge table to create a random magical effect. Tides of Chaos: Starting at 1st level, you can manipulate the forces of chance and chaos to gain advantage on one attack roll, ability check, or saving throw.
